A simple GPS track, using Raspberry Zero and WaweShare GPRS Hat. 
This system permit to receive an SMS, with coodinates and view on google maps, every time an horizontal movement is detected (is possibile to set the distance on Line 46)
It's possible for a vertical movement too, uncommented Line 140
Is possibile to send an sms to the GPRS to receive as answer the position...simply sending the keyword "Check". 

Many thanks @daveake (Dave Akerman) and @olaf-hoops to have shared ideas and instructions, this projetc in based on those.
